[x] Work out how to convert the locations into lat/longs
[] Spike how to use neo spatial

Use cases:
I'm at stop X, want to get to stop Y
-- [] Tell me what bus/buses to get
-- [] Show me the different stops that my journey will go through


START current=node:stops(code = '10001'), home=node:stops(code = '6410') 
MATCH p = shortestPath( current-[*..50]->home) 
RETURN p;;

START current=node:stops(code = '10001'), home=node:stops(code = '6372')  
MATCH p = allShortestPaths( current-[*..50]->home)  
RETURN p;;

START current=node:stops(code = '14456'), home=node:stops(code = 'BP2390')  
MATCH p = allShortestPaths( current-[*..50]->home)  
RETURN extract(n in nodes(p) : n.name), extract(r in relationships(p) : r.bus_number);;

START current=node:stops("code:*")
MATCH current-[r:route]->otherStop
RETURN current, otherStop, COUNT(otherStop) AS numberOfStops
ORDER BY numberOfStops

START n1=node:stops(code = '3178'), n2 = node:stops(code = '20462')
MATCH n1-[r:route]->n2
RETURN n1,n2,r
